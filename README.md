# Covid19 Tracker App
## Introduction
Deployed on [Netlify](covid19trackworld.netlify.app).
This is a web app for people to track the covid19 positive case, death case, and recovery numbers. The data is fetched from the API and cards displaying the statistics as well as Charts. I made this along with the [Javacript Mastery Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khJlrj3Y6Ls) to solidify my knowledge of React and React Hooks.
